Synopsis

This is a Ruby on Rails application that uses JSON Data to append information the DOM. The goal of this application is to iterate over the JSON data coming from the server and retrieving the information that is needed. The code base uses Javascript, HTML and CSS. A little bit of ruby is also used to navigate the application.

In order to get the application up running you will need Ruby on Rails installed on your computer. Please follow the steps below:

Step 1: Check Ruby Version

First, check if you already have Ruby installed. Open the command prompt and type ruby -v. If Ruby responds, and if it shows a version number at or above 2.2.2, then type gem --version. If you don't get an error, skip Install Ruby step. Otherwise, we'll install a fresh Ruby.


Step 2: Install Ruby

If Ruby is not installed, then download an installation package from rubyinstaller.org. Follow the download link, and run the resulting installer. This is an exe file rubyinstaller-2.2.2.x.exe and will be installed in a single click. It's a very small package, and you'll get RubyGems as well along with this package.


Step 3: Install Rails

Install Rails − With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line − C:\> gem install rails
The above command may take some time to install all dependencies. Make sure you stay connected to the internet while installing gems dependencies.
















Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
